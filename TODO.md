# SwissArmyKnifeGIS - Future Features

## Priority Features

- [ ] **GIS File Merger/Combiner** - Merge multiple GIS files (vectors or rasters) into a single output. Combine Shapefiles, merge raster tiles, batch process datasets.

- [ ] **Spatial Analysis & Geometry Operations** - Perform geometric operations: buffer features, calculate intersections/unions/differences, simplify geometry, calculate area/distance, dissolve/aggregate features.

## Brainstorm - Future Additions

- [ ] **Raster to Vector Conversion** - Convert raster grids to vector polygons/lines
- [ ] **Vector to Raster Conversion** - Rasterize vector layers to grid format
- [ ] **Layer Statistics & Reporting** - Generate reports: bounds, CRS, feature count, data types
- [ ] **Attribute Table Viewer** - View and edit GIS layer attribute tables
- [ ] **Data Validation & Quality Check** - Validate geometries, detect overlaps/gaps/errors
- [ ] **Extract/Filter by Attribute** - Filter features based on attribute value queries
- [ ] **Distance & Proximity Analysis** - Find features within distance, nearest neighbor analysis
- [ ] **Batch Processing** - Automate workflows on multiple files
- [ ] **Map Preview & Styling** - Quick visualization with basic symbology
- [ ] **Export Formats** - Convert between GIS formats (Shapefile ↔ GeoJSON ↔ GeoPackage)
